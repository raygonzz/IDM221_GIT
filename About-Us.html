	<p>Our work speaks for itself, but don’t just take our word for it. Here’s what some of our satisfied customers have to say:</p>
	<img class="review-photo-1" src="Graphics/IMG_1194.JPG" alt="aluminum fence">
	<p>"Ray and his team did an exceptional job. They responded promptly to multiple requests for various estimates. They arrived on the day they said they would start and did an amazing job removing brush and old chain-link fence and replacing it with a lovely white cedar shadow box fence. We received several estimates and they beat all of them." — Anita</p>
	<img class="review-photo-2" src="Graphics/IMG_1120.JPG" alt="vinyl fence">
	<p>"Installed 6ft high vinyl fence in rear yard. Removed old existing wooden fence. Installed new gate and hardware. Cleaned up all old trash and materials and hauled away. I had other estimates. Bergo gave a good price and did not require any money up front. I paid when job was done. Very satisfied with the work they did. All done in a professional manner. I will use him again if I need more fencing." — Wilbur</p>
